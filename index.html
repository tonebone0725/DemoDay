      <p> I want to be a lawyer the only thing I have a problem trying to figure out if I will be able to get a scholarship.</p>
      
      <p> I am going to College if its the last thing I do.</p>
      
      <p> My favorite thing in life is the power to learn from your mistakes you get knocked down you get back up again.</p>

      <p>I am 17 years old and I am the type to think outside the box and nothing to me is better than learning new things.</p>
    
      <p>I love sports but this year I don't think I will be taking up any extra-curricular programs this year.</P> 

      <p>I am a very intellegent young man I have a 4.0 GPA and I am still working hard to get to college.</P> 
  
      <p>I also think of others before myself I am a very compassionate person and I love helping others.</P>
