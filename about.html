    <p> My reflection for the Englewood Codes program is that everything given in this class will be helpful in the future and it will make it much easier for us to get jobs or be self employed by making websites for all that need them.
     I learned lots of new info and it seems that I can barely take my eyes off the screen when I am coding.</p>
    
    <p> Englewood Codes is something that u can use to start a web firm if that is something you want to do.</p>
    
    <p> I personally find myself feeling like this is something that is important to me and I believe that this is very useful imformation.</p>
    
    <p> I think that more people should start doingt the Englewood Codes program.</p>
